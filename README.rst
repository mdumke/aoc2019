===================
Advent of Code 2019
===================

My solutions for the programming challenges posted at https://adventofcode.com/2019.

The focus is on readability and modularity, and I will try to use these exercises for practicing good programming habits as well. This includes documentation and automated testing.

.. code:: sh
  # run the test suite for a given day
  python -m unittest test.py

  # compute the solution for a given day
  ./solution.py < input.txt


Prerequisites
-------------

- Python >= 3.7
