====================
Day 3: Crossed Wires
====================

Compute crossing-locations of two wires and find the crossings with (a) minimum manhattan distance from the origin and (b) the minimum wire-length. The main entry point is ``solution.py``, and the main logic is implemented in ``wire.py``.

.. code:: sh

  # usage:
  ./solution.py < input.txt
